// why we need servers?
// 1. to serve static files (html, css, js, images, etc.)
// 2. to handle dynamic requests (e.g. form submissions, API requests, etc.)
// 3. to handle authentication and authorization
// 4. to handle sessions and cookies
// 5. to handle database interactions
// 6. to handle real-time communication (e.g. WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, etc.)
// if we have our own pc and laptop then why we are using servers?
// because servers are more powerful and can handle more requests than our personal computers
// servers are also more reliable and can run 24/7 without any issues
// servers are also more secure and can be protected from attacks and vulnerabilities
// servers are also more scalable and can handle more traffic as needed
// servers are also more cost-effective and can save us money in the long run
// servers are also more flexible and can be customized to meet our specific needs
